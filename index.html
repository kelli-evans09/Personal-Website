        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. This is your world. There comes a nice little fluffer. There it is. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Anything you want to do you can do here. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Be brave. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>
